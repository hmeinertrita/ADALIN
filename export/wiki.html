Their skin is rough and form ridges that give it an almost rock-like appearance. Their eyes do not have pupils or irises, instead they are a solid colour, typically a traditional jewel tone.</p><h2 class="">Names</h2><p>Alkali names typically consist of a given name and a lineage name. Given names are typically disyllabic, a combination of two consonant-vowel syllables (e.g. 'Ka&quot; or &quot;Mo&quot;) or single vowel syllables (e.g. &quot;E&quot; or &quot;U&quot;).</p><p>The lineage name is an Alkali tradition that date back before the race became spacefaring. Historically, an Alkali will take the given name of someone they look up to as their lineage name. At birth, an Alkali's lineage name is the given name of one of their parents. Once they come of age, however, they can change it though it is uncommon.</p><p>After the Ascendancy rose to power however, the tradition shifted slightly. Now it is more common than not that parents will give their child a lineage name after an important figure in the Ascendancy canon. If an Alkali changes their name later in life, it is typically to another figure in the Ascendancy canon. Though this is now common practice for the majority of the Alkali in the system, those living in the <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves" href="#United%20Eleusian%20Federation">UEF</a> sometimes use the old practice.</p></div>

Ms. Lavender is in charge of designing and running all live stage performances for Kacy. This includes mostly live music concerts with singing and dancing, but will occasionally include theatre or stage adaptations of the shows. </p><p>She is often credited as the woman behind Kacy has the Candy but is quick to point out that she's not the only one responsible. She was the project lead at Crown Voyage when Kacy was just starting and is credibly responsible for most (if not all) of Kacy's success as a media franchise. She effectively built it from the ground up before stepping aside to just handle the live performances. This was after the project blew up such that she could no longer feasibly oversee all parts of it. Those who work closely with her know of her meticulous perfectionism, overbearing micromanaging, and headstrong ambition. She attempts to exercise control over every tiny thing she can. Though this results in a general dislike of working alongside and under her, no one can argue with her results: the most successful media phenomenon in recent history.</p><p>Her role in Kacy's success has made her somewhat of a celebrity in her own right, and Crown Voyage will often position her as the creative genius behind Kacy. While this is mostly true, it is also true that Lilac used to be an executive on the board of directors for <a class="tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing" href="#Crown%20Voyage%20Automedia">Crown Voyage's Automedia Branch</a>, a branch dedicated to computer generated media. They churned out media completely generated algorithmically with little creative work from people. Lilac voluntarily stepped down from the board to head the Kacy project, which at the time was relatively unsuccessful and most thought it was a lost cause. Lilac took (and does take) a very corporate executive approach to running Kacy Has The Candy despite this vision of her as an artistic visionary.</p></div>
