title: Solanite

Solanite is a mysterious mineral that can only be found in the [[Solanite River]]. It is valued for its extreme rarity as well as its practical properties. Not much is known about the properties of Solanite, beyond its use as a extremely potent power source and incredible durability when used in synthetic alloys.

Solanite is extremely rare and only forms naturally in the Solanite River, though it is unknown why. Much of it has already been mined over the system's history, rendering most small-scale mining operations fruitless. As a result, most people attempting to acquire Solanite either steal it from someone else, or harvest it from old [[Shepherd|Shepherd Covalence Mineral Expanse]] technology.
