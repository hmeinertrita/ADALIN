title: Oasis

Oasis is an environmental movement that combats the destructive tendencies of both the governments and mega-corporations of the system. There is little formal structure to the organization and as a result, many of its members have wildly different belief systems, from peaceful activists to militant radicals. A lot of Oasis activity comes out of the planet [[Rilgar]].
