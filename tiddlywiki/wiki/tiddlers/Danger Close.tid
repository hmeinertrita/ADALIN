title: Danger Close

A modified [[C.DEV-A|DEV-A]] put together by [[Strawberry Moon]] as a favour owed to [[Quebec]]. While most would mistake it as a very early [[Agraria Bluelake]] frame, it is actually an old [[Shepherd|Shepherd Covalence Mineral Expanse]] mech, one of the ones early Bluelakes were modeled after. As such, it is much sturdier than most other DEV-A and can most notably survive an orbital drop. 

It is a sturdy machine that has served Quebec well, but sustained extreme damage in their last fight, and currently remains non-functional, but intact.
