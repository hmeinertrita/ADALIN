Humans are foreign settlers of the [[Eleusian System]]. They arrived eons ago with the [[Shepherd Covalence Mineral Expanse]], a mining company on the frontier of space exploration. They settled in the [[asteroid belt on the outer reaches of the system|Solanite River]] long before any of the native species of the system developed space-faring technology.
