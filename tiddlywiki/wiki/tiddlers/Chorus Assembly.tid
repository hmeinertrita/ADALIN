title: Chorus Assembly

The Chorus Assembly is the governing body of [[Nexus]]. Though they are separate from the other two major governments in the [[Eleusian System]], they have little power of their own. Their existence is mainly due to the need for a third party mediator between the [[UEF|United Eleusian Federation]] and the [[Ascendancy|Ascendancy for the Eternal Paragon]]. What little power they have is afforded to them by their role as a mediating body.
