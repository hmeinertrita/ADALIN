title: Union IX

Union IX is a humongous gas giant orbiting around [[Euthenia]]. While the actual planet itself is not rich with valuable resources, it has dozens of moons with various levels of valuable space and resources. Corporations and other organizations who wish to escape the public eye will often operate a facility on one of these moons. [[Agraria|Agraria Natural Resources & Distribution]] owns the vast majority moons on Union IX.
