title: Nexus Mainstay

The Nexus Mainstay is the primary security force on [[Nexus]]. They are affiliated with the [[Chorus Assembly]] and handle most elements of policing and general security for the general population of Nexus. They do not have a lot of resources and as a result, most corporations and visitors to Nexus rely on their own private security.
