Kacy has long [[silvery pearlescent/iridescent|https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBNqezE.img]] hair that is never short though she will often wear it in different styles. Her iconic look for Coronation is a large off-the-shoulder powder pink tulle ballgown. The gown has floral patterns on it and while it reaches the floor, the fabric of the dress is a gradient from opaque to mostly-transparent around mid-thigh, revealing that she is wearing pink high heels with gold embellishments.
