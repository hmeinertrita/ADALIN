Quebec was the founder and leader of [[Pantheon]] before she disappeared mysteriously. She was a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and [[DEV-A]] pilot. 

Coming from a military background, Quebec decided she wasnâ€™t happy with her living conditions. She put together the team with combined goals of escaping the status quo lifestyle of the Eleusian System and making a quick cred or two along the way. She put together and lead the team using her various friends and contacts.

Quebec was a strict and disciplined leader, but could often be found entertaining herself with her various hobbies such as playing guitar or exercising. She was a solitary person by nature, enjoying time by herself but would happily participate in group activities. She had a keen eye for seeing the potential in people and could bring the best out of them which made her a very effective leader. She had a very strong sense of idealism and optimism that could be overlooked due to to her low-key personality, but it is what attracted her loyal network of friends and contacts.

She was severely injured on her last mission in the field when her mech, [[Danger Close]], sustained heavy damage at the hands of a group called the [[Blue Cavalry]]. She then grew depressed and angry with her situation and distanced herself from the rest of the Pantheon. She disappeared a few month later without a single trace, except for a missing board game piece.
