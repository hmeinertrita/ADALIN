title: Physalis

Physalis is a tiny tropical planet orbiting [[Euthenia]]. The whole planet is one gigantic but sparse archipelago of tropical islands. Due to the shallow nature of the oceans and Physalis' large moon, each island has unusually large beaches, with about 40% of all landmasses on the planet being sandy beaches. Despite it's beauty, Physalis has an extremely toxic atmosphere, making it unsuitable for most foreign life. Some of the extremely wealthy residents of the system have set up resort getaways dotted around the planet.
