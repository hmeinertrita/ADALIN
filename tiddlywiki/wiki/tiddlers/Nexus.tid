title: Nexus

Nexus, known as the crossroads planet, is located in transit around the [[Eleusian System]]. It is unique because at the point the binary stars orbital cycle where [[Euthenia]] and [[Eucleia]] are closest to each other, Nexus will switch which star it orbits. This makes it a vital stop for anyone wishing to cross from one side of the system to the other, and the time when it switches a period of mass migration within the system.

Nexus is the planet furthest from either star, and therefore the coldest. Apart from the large cities, the planet itself is an icy wasteland. This makes Nexus less of a destination and more of a pit stop for those who travel there. However, it does serve as an essential and neutral place for diplomatic communications between the [[UEF|United Eleusian Federation]] and the [[Ascendancy|Ascendancy for the Eternal Paragon]].

Nexus is governed by its own government known as the [[Chorus Assembly]]. The Assembly is aligned with neither the Federation or the Ascendancy. The Assembly has almost no power of its own, and what little it does have comes from its role as a mediator between the two larger governments.
