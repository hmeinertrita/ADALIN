title: Ilanthians

A moth-like people hailing from the planet [[Ilanthus]]. Despite their home orbiting the [[Ascendancy|Ascendancy for the Eternal Paragon]] controlled [[Euthenia]] star, a significant (though not majority) portion of Ilanthians pledge allegiance to the [[UEF|United Eleusian Federation]].

! Appearance
The Ilanthians are a species of humanoid moths. They have two sets of arms and sprout a pair of large wings behind them. They are covered in tufts of fluffy fur that will change appearance depending on the health of the Ilanthian. The fur of a healthy Ilanthian will retain an almost metallic sheen at its ends but an unhealthy Ilanthian's fur will appear dulled in colour and sheen.
