title: Shepherd Covalence Mineral Expanse

The Shepherd Covalence Mineral Expanse was an ancient mining corporation that settled the [[Eleusian System]] eons ago. All remnants of them have since fallen into the ruin, and no one knows what exactly happened to them. Old installations and mining colonies can be found in the asteroid belt called the [[Solanite River]] on the outskirts of the system. Many of these abandoned settlements have been taken over again by the [[Shepherd's Railway]].

Their technology is known to be extremely advanced and long-lasting. They used [[Solanite]] based alloys and power-sources to dramatically increase the lifetime of their equipment. Shepherd mechs served as the basis of many of the system's current [[DEV-A]], in particular the [[Agraria Bluelake]].
