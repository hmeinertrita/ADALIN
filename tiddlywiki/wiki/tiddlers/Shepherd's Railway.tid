title: Shepherd's Railway

The Shepherd's Railway are a group of people living in the ruins of the [[Solanite River]] asteroid belt. They are mostly composed of outcasts, exiles, pirates, and scavengers who either could not of chose not to live within the system. They are named after the hardlight rail system built by the [[Shepherd Covalence Mineral Expanse]] that traverses the entire asteroid belt.
